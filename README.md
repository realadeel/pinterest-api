This is the Ruby gem for interacting with the official [Pinterest REST API](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/).  

This gem uses Faraday and Hashie to make requests and parse the responses.

## Usage

Obtain an access token from Pinterest. You can generate one [here](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/api/access_token/).

$ gem install pinterest

```ruby
require 'pinterest-api'

client = Pinterest::Client.new(ACCESS_TOKEN)

# Get the authenticated user's Pinterest account info
client.me

# Get the pins that the authenticated user likes
client.get_likes

# Get the authenticated user's followers
client.get_followers

# Get the boards that the authenticated user follows
client.get_followed_boards

# Get the Pinterest users that the authenticated user follows
client.get_followed_users

# Get the interests that the authenticated user follows
client.get_followed_interests

# Follow a user
client.follow_user('shopseen')

# Unfollow a user
client.unfollow_user('shopseen')

# Follow a board
client.follow_board(<board_id>)

# Unfollow a board
client.unfollow_board(<board_id>)

# Follow an interest
client.follow_interest(<interest_id>)

# Unfollow an interest
client.unfollow_interest(<interest_id>)

# Search for authenticated users's pins related to shoes
client.get_pins(query: 'shoes')  

# Search for authenticated users's boards related to shoes
client.get_boards(query: 'shoes')

# Get the account info for a Pinterest user
client.get_user('<username>')

```

## Authentication
You can generate access tokens through the link above, or you can use Oauth
Authentication

In your app, make sure you have the omniauth gem installed. Add the following
to your ```intializers/omniauth.rb``` file

```ruby

Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :pinterest, ENV['PINTEREST_APP_ID'], ENV['PINTEREST_APP_SECRET']
end

```

Direct your users to ```/auth/pinterest```

Once they approve your app, they'll be redirect to your callback URL, which
should be something like ```auth/pinterest/callback``` with a hash of
Oauth values from Pinterest in ```request.env['omniauth.auth']```
